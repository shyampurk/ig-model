Infographic Modelling Framework

A framework for visualizing worldly phenomena using custom information graphics. The world is essentially an interconnected web of complex transactions being undertaken by its inhabitants which can have a direct or indirect impact on all or a subset of the populace.

The goal of this framework is to visualize the causes and effects of these transactions by simulating the scenarios. The fundamental assumption and objective behind developing this framework is that most of the worldly phenomena are invisible to us and their impact is only felt when it impacts us in the form of struggle (for example, struggle for survival). Be it the US subprime crisis , or the global warming, every such crisis has its root on an equilibrium state of the world which is disturbed as a result of a series of transactions. This framework could be used to visualize the entire cause and effect story from the equilibrium state to the imbalanced state.

Similarly, it is also hoped that this framework can help to model and visualize many such phenomena which are difficult to gauge or perceive through naked eye. The best possible example which I can offer is the distribution of government collected tax from the treasury to the public scheme. An assessment of such processes through a visual model can help us to visualize the invisible and foresee the unforeseen. That is the final goal of this framework
